- 👋 Hi, I’m @UchiTesting
- I did a bit of everything in IT (Support, tech, operator, developer (as intern to date))
- I love the .NET stack of technologies. I have been trained C# and worked with:
  - WPF
  - Xamarin
  - ASP .NET MVC
  - LINQ
  - Entity Framework
  - SQL Server
  - Visual Studio as IDE
  - VS Code
- I did complete my knowledge with:
  - ASP .NET Core
  - EF Core
  - .NET MAUI
  - React
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java** in a training until December 2022. The training teaches:
  - Java OOP
  - UML
  - GIT (I use GIT for years already yet I learnt a few cool things)
  - HTML CSS
  - JS
  - SQL
  - Angular
  - JPA
  - JFS
  - Spring
- In my free time I am currently learning **Jenkins**. 
I plan to refresh my **Docker** knowledge from the notes I took on a course. 
[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-complete) got completed with **Kubernetes** (thanks [@bstashchuk](https://github.com/bstashchuk/)).
I will complete my notes and work on it at a later time.
- 👀 I’m interested in IT (I know. Suprising, right?) focusing on development
- In my free time I play video games (just a bit to relax), listen to music, on occasion 
play-around with sound design, photography and computer graphics (mostly GIMP or Inkscape).
