- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UchiTesting
- I did a bit of everything in IT (Tech Support, Operator, Developer)
- I love the .NET stack of technologies. I have been trained C# and worked with:
  - WPF, Xamarin, ASP .NET MVC
  - LINQ, Entity Framework, SQL Server
  - Visual Studio as IDE (for .NET) and VS Code as code editor (for front-end mostly)
  - .NET CLI
- I did complete my knowledge with:
  - ASP .NET Core
  - EF Core
  - .NET MAUI
  - React
- ðŸŒ± Prepared and passed a **Java** Full-Stack certification until end of November 2022. The training teaches:
  - Java OOP
  - UML
  - GIT (I use GIT for years already yet I learnt a few cool things)
  - HTML, CSS, JS
  - SQL, JPA Hibernate
  - Angular, JFS, Spring
  - Eclipse as an IDE
- In my free time I am currently learning **K8S** stuff
- I am currently working as a developer for a digital services company.

[This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-complete) got completed with **Kubernetes** (thanks [@bstashchuk](https://github.com/bstashchuk/)).
I will complete my notes and work on it at a later time
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT (I know. Suprising, right?) focusing on development
- In my free time I play video games (just a bit to relax), listen to music, on occasion 
play-around with sound design, photography and computer graphics (mostly GIMP or Inkscape)
